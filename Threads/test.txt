In this example, you will learn how to use the asynchronous methods provided by the ForkJoinPool
and ForkJoinTask classes for the management of tasks. You are going to implement a program that
will search for files with a determined extension inside a folder and its subfolders. The ForkJoinTask
class youâ€™re going to implement will process the content of a folder. For each subfolder inside that
folder, it will send a new task to the ForkJoinPool class in an asynchronous way. For each file inside
that folder, the task will check the extension of the file and add it to the result list if it proceeds.
